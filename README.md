# toString_Generator

This tool will save you a lot of time writing out custom toString methods for your classes

Another useful feature  is that while you're running your String application, 
you can simply hit "run" on the toString application, then it will show up right in 
the console to copy and paste directly into your Spring app. You don't have to stop 
running your Spring app. 

Super convenient.
