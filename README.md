# toString_Generator
A tool that generates a toString() method override to place in your classes.


The useful thing about this too is that while you're running your String application, 
you can simply hit "run" on the toString application, then it will show up right in the
console to copy and paste directly into your Spring app. You don't have to stop running anything. 

Super convenient.
